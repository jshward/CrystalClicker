# Crystal Clicker
Live version: https://jshward.github.io/CrystalClicker/
Built using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

### Instructions
On load you'll be presented with 4 crystals and a randomly-generated number to match. 
Each crystal has a randomly generated value, and you have to try and match your score to the randomly generated target value by clicking the crystals.

In the future, should I revisit this project, I'd like to upgrade the visuals. 
I'm quite happy with the gems themselves, but the rest needs some love.
I'm thinking something with a yellow type-face and some graphics to bring to mind a treasure chest

#### Why I Tend to Highlight This Project

For whatever reason, I tend to think very highly of both this project and the [Giphy API project](https://github.com/jshward/giphyapp) . 
I think in both cases, everything really clicked for me and the coding came very naturally, which is a truly great feeling.
